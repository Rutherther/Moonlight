This is a fork of Roxeez/Moonlight. I migrated it to .NET Standard so it can be used on Linux as well as Windows.

# Moonlight

Moonlight aims to make NosTale .NET Application developer life easier by giving them access to a complete & easy to use API allowing them to interact with (almost) everything in the game  
Moonlight can be used with local client (injected .dll) or remote client (clientless)

## Getting Started

### .NET Framework with local client

- Create a C# .dll project targeting .NET Framework 4.7+
- Add Moonlight dependency
- Install DllExport to your project and create your export function (cf. DllExport wiki)
- Install Costura.Fody to your project so you don't have to copy all dependencies to NosTale folder
- Build your project
- Create database.db using Moonlight.Toolkit CLI
- Copy previously generated database.db to a subfolder named Moonlight in your NosTale folder
- Copy your generated .dll & MoonlightCore to your NosTale folder
- Copy SQLitePCLRaw.batteries_v2.dll, SQLitePCLRaw.provider.dynamic_cdecl.dll, SQLitePCLRaw.core.dll, SQLitePCLRaw.nativelibrary.dll to NosTale folder
  - if you encounter SqliteException with inner exception of "The path is not of a legal form." check that you added these files to NosTale folder
- Copy runtimes folder
- Inject your .dll using an injector supporting custom export function.

> Moonlight is a packet based lib, so if you want everything to work correctly using local client, it should be injected before character selection.

### .NET Core with remote client

> Moonlight remote client currently supports only Gameforge official client with Gameforge auth

- Create a C# .NET Core console project
- Add Moonlight dependency
- Use GameforgeApi to obtain sessionToken (You can use GenerateInstallationId for unique id generation based on email and password)
  - First call GetAuthToken
  - Then use GetAccounts and select account you want to use
  - Call GetSessionToken for account you want to use
- Initializa MoonlightAPI and NosTale
- Use NosTale.InitLogin to obtain instance of NosTaleLogin
- Use NosTale login to Connect to server you want and then Login using correct parameters
- Register listener to event NostaleLogin.ServersReceived
- You may connect to a channel using NosTaleLogin.ConnectToWorld with Channels received in your listener
  - You will obtain NosTaleWorld
- Register listener to event NosTaleWorld.CharactersListReceived
- You may Select a character from one of the received
- Finally send StartGame to start the game

## Example
>Example application can be found here : https://github.com/Rutherther/Moonlight.SimplePiiBot
```csharp
public void Start()
{
    if (IsRunning)
    {
        return;
    }

    IsRunning = true;

    _runningTask = Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        Character character = Client.Character;

         while (IsRunning)
        {
            IEnumerable<Monster> allPii;

            do
            {
                Monster pod;
                do
                {
                    pod = await GetClosest(MonsterConstants.SoftPiiPodVnum);
                    if (pod == null)
                    {
                        await Task.Delay(100);
                    }
                }
                while (pod == null);

                await character.Attack(pod);

                allPii = await GetClose(MonsterConstants.SoftPiiVnum);

                await Task.Delay(100);
            }
            while (allPii.Count() < 10);

            await character.Attack(allPii.First());
         }
    });
}

private async Task<Monster> GetClosest(int vnum)
{
    return (await GetClose(vnum)).FirstOrDefault();
}

private async Task<IEnumerable<Monster>> GetClose(int vnum)
{
    return Client.Character.Map.Monsters
            .Where(x => x.Vnum == vnum)
            .Where(x => x.Position.IsInRange(Client.Character.Position, 10))
            .OrderBy(x => x.Position.GetDistance(Client.Character.Position));
}
```
